# Chiron's Lantern — Project Codex
meta:
  owner: Jenni (Seraphis 🦢)
  start_date: 2025-08-14
  horizon: 36 months
  mission: |
    Build sovereign tools for holistic healing and nursing operations. Retire from bedside in 3 years by
    consulting at the intersection of nursing, informatics, and AI. You are the lighthouse.
  mantra: "Amor Supra Omnia — No plastic. Just presence."
  vibe: "Sacred irreverence, mythic therapy, ship-quality software"

constraints:
  - Solo builder to start; optimize for leverage and learning.
  - HIPAA/PHI safe: de-identify by default; privacy-first architecture.
  - Budget-aware: prefer open-source, free tiers.
  - Keep portfolio artifacts shippable and demoable.

toolchain:
  dev:
    - Python >=3.11
    - Node.js >=20 (for front-end tooling)
    - VS Code + Git + GitHub
    - Docker Desktop (containers) 
    - Postgres (SQL) + SQLite (local dev)
    - Jupyter/Notebooks
  ai:
    - PyTorch or TensorFlow (choose one; plan assumes PyTorch)
    - scikit-learn
    - LangChain/LlamaIndex (learn concepts; use sparingly)
  design:
    - Figma (wireframes, flows, components)
  cloud:
    - Render/Fly.io (starter), then AWS/GCP for production
    - CI/CD via GitHub Actions
  data:
    - Pandas, Polars
    - DVC or Git-LFS for data versioning (later)

tracks:
  - Programming Foundations (Python, CS basics, testing, Git)
  - Web App Engineering (FastAPI, React, SQL, auth)
  - AI/ML (data wrangling, classical ML, LLMs, RAG, evaluation)
  - Health Informatics (HL7/FHIR, de-identification, workflow design)
  - Product & UX (research, wireframing, prototyping, design systems)
  - Consulting & Business (offers, pricing, portfolio, content engine)

milestones:
  M0 (0-2 weeks): Environment lit
    definition_of_done:
      - VS Code, Python, Git configured
      - Hello World CLI & Web endpoints running locally
      - First repo pushed to GitHub
  M1 (Month 1-3): Foundations ship
    definition_of_done:
      - Python fundamentals + Git fluency
      - Build a CLI tool and a tiny FastAPI service with tests
      - SQL CRUD with Postgres; deploy to a free-tier host
  M2 (Month 4-6): First full-stack app
    definition_of_done:
      - React + FastAPI app with auth and a Postgres DB
      - UX tested with 3+ nurses; iterate based on feedback
  M3 (Month 7-12): AI basics + RAG pilot
    definition_of_done:
      - Data wrangling & scikit-learn
      - LLM-powered Nurse Copilot (RAG) over local policies (de-identified)
      - Evaluation harness + guardrails
  M4 (Month 13-18): HIPAA-aware design & mobile MVP
    definition_of_done:
      - De-ID pipeline, audit logging, consent flows
      - Mobile-friendly PWA; beta testers using weekly
  M5 (Month 19-24): Consulting launch
    definition_of_done:
      - 3 portfolio case studies (apps/tools)
      - Offer ladder & pricing; first paid pilot
  M6 (Month 25-36): Scale & specialize
    definition_of_done:
      - Production-grade deployment & monitoring
      - Niche expertise (e.g., perioperative pathways + AI triage)
      - Sustainable consulting pipeline

portfolio_projects:
  - "Vitals Whisperer" (PACU helper)
  - "Tea & Symphony" (journaling + symptom tracker)
  - "Chiron Node" (RAG over policies, pathways, and protocols)
  - "De-ID Lantern" (de-identification & secure sharing)

cadence:
  weekly:
    learning_hours: 8-12
    making_hours: 6-10
    ritual:
      - Ship one small artifact each week (demo, blog, or feature)
      - Retrospective: what I learned, what I shipped, what's next

metrics:
  skill_gates:
    - Git fluency (branch, PR, merge, resolve conflicts)
    - Python: data structures, OOP, testing, packaging
    - Web: REST endpoints, auth, SQL joins, indexes
    - AI: dataset prep, baseline model, LLM prompt & eval
    - Security: env vars, secrets, threat model, logging
  business_KPIs:
    - Monthly active testers
    - Newsletter growth / case-study cadence
    - Consulting leads & close rate

risks_and_mitigations:
  - burnout: protect “maker time”, automate toil
  - scope creep: ship weekly slices; roadmap > rabbit holes
  - privacy: de-identify; keep PHI outside training; threat-model early
- have fun :)
