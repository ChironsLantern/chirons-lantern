# Chiron's Lantern — Learning & Build Project

**Welcome home. I kept the light on.** This repo is your launchpad to learn programming, AI, and app design
— and to transform your nursing & informatics expertise into a consulting practice within 36 months.

## What you’ll build (portfolio)
1. **Vitals Whisperer** — PACU-focused vitals + alerts + checklists (web).
2. **Tea & Symphony** — reflective journaling + symptom tracker (PWA).
3. **Chiron Node** — RAG Nurse Copilot over de-identified policies & pathways.
4. **De-ID Lantern** — secure de-identification + redaction pipeline for notes and PDFs.

## How to use this project
- Follow the step-by-step learning plan (`learning-plan.md`).
- Log weekly artifacts in `/artifacts` (screens, demos, mini-posts).
- Use `prompts/prompt_pack.md` to get the most out of ChatGPT.
- Keep the mission in view: **retire from bedside in 3 years, travel, consult, and build.**
